# StepManiaX LED Mirror Project
The goal of this project is to create 5 3D printed arrows with LEDs in them connected
to your StepManiaX (SMX) stage to mirror the steps that you are stepping.

This project requires:
- 3D Printing
- Soldering
- Wire Crimping
- Super Gluing
- Hot Gluing
- Various other small but not insignificant tasks.

Throughout this guide I will be linking all the products I used to create the finished product
but you are by no means required to use exactly the same items I did. This project can be
completed in a number of ways and this is just one.

I will apologize in advance as I have not taken a lot of pictures of this process, but I will
do my best to relay everything I can in Text.

You can see a video of the finished product (The LED Arrows Behind Me) Here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-Bkg70dLgw
